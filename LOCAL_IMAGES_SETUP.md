# ✅ LOCAL PRODUCT IMAGES SETUP COMPLETE

## What I Did

I successfully created a local image system for your electronics store! Here's what was done:

### 1. Created Directory Structure
```
public/
  └── images/
      └── products/
          ├── esp32.png
          ├── hc-sr04.png
          ├── l298n.png
          ├── jumper-wires.png
          ├── breadboard.png
          ├── sg90.png
          ├── mg996r.png
          ├── relay.png
          ├── ir-sensor.png
          ├── battery-18650.png
          ├── usb-cable.png
          ├── pcb-board.png
          └── microsd.png
```

### 2. Copied All Your Uploaded Images
**Total: 13 high-quality product images** stored locally in `public/images/products/`

### 3. Updated `src/data.js`
Changed image URLs from external Unsplash links to local paths:
- ✅ ESP32 Development Board → `/images/products/esp32.png`
- ✅ HC-SR04 Sensor → `/images/products/hc-sr04.png`
- ✅ L298N Motor Driver → `/images/products/l298n.png` (AI-generated)
- ✅ Jumper Wires → `/images/products/jumper-wires.png`
- ✅ Breadboard → `/images/products/breadboard.png`
- ✅ SG90 Servo → `/images/products/sg90.png`
- ✅ MG996R Servo → `/images/products/mg996r.png`
- ✅ Relay Module → `/images/products/relay.png`
- ✅ IR Sensor → `/images/products/ir-sensor.png`
- ✅ 18650 Battery → `/images/products/battery-18650.png`
- ✅ USB Cable → `/images/products/usb-cable.png`
- ✅ PCB Board → `/images/products/pcb-board.png`
- ✅ MicroSD Card → `/images/products/microsd.png`

*Note: Products 9, 11, and 16-20 still use Unsplash placeholders. If you want images for these, just upload them and I'll add them!*

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add images for the remaining products:

1. **Buck Converter** (Product #9)
2. **Battery Holder** (Product #11)

Just upload the images and I'll add them to the local directory!
